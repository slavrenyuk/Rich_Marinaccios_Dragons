It's important that {~add-ons/Rich_Marinaccios_Dragons/macros} export precedes the [+units] section,
since the macros should be processed before the dragon unit declaration

>>> ANIMATION MACROS DESCRIPTION
animation_utils.cfg file contains macros for the dragons animation. It has a DRAGON_ANIMATION macro which includes all
the other macro from the file, and additionally sets the corresponding defend animation and the dragon image.

The usage is {DRAGON_ANIMATION DRAGON_NAME}, where DRAGON_NAME is one of ancient-dragon, gold-dragon or young-dragon
The DRAGON_ANIMATION should be placed within the unit_type declaration. It will create all the required unit animations.
Particularly, there are animations for "bite", "tail" and "fire breath" attacks. Also there are several standing
animation variations and extra animations. Standing animation variation may be turned on by setting the corresponding
unit variable (standing variations will not smoothly work on attacks, so use it only to make the scenario nicer if required)
The extra animation can be used with animate_unit directive.

See animation_utils.cfg for details and Ancient_Dragon.cfg as an example.
